# Libft-prime

This is an improved version of libft with all the changes that I add throughout the 42 cursus.
The version with only the required functions by the original subject can be found [here](https://github.com/palgarob/Libft).
Apart from some custom functions, it also contains the code for the functions get_next_line
and ft_printf from the projects of the 42 cursus with the same name.
